<p><a title="Original story" href="http://jomc.unc.edu/news-items/wralcoms-john-clark-to-lead-digital-news-project-at-unc-journalism-school" target="_blank"><em>The University of North Carolina School of Journalism and Mass Communication reports:</em></a></p>
<p>John Clark, WRAL.com general manager, is joining the faculty at the UNC  School of Journalism and Mass Communication on July 1 to lead the  school&#8217;s Reese Felts digital news and audience research project.</p>
<p>Clark  helped build WRAL.com into one of the most successful local news  websites in the nation, growing traffic to more than 1 billion page  views last year. He deployed a mobile news strategy and established a  strong social media presence for the site, which has won the Edward R.  Murrow Award for best broadcast-affiliated website, the Editor &amp;  Publisher award for best local TV-affiliated website and a regional Emmy  for continuing coverage, among other awards under Clark&#8217;s leadership.</p>
<p>He  takes over a signature program of the UNC journalism school&#8217;s push into  the digital media environment &#8211; funded by a $4.1 million estate gift by  Carolina alumnus Reese Felts. The Felts digital news project’s mission  is to help industries, companies and entrepreneurs create innovative  solutions for content, advertising and marketing through student-based  research and experimentation. The project&#8217;s news site, <a title="news site" href="http://www.reesenews.org" target="_blank">reesenews.org</a>,  launched in November 2010 and has drawn national recognition including  the best online sports reporting award from the Society of Professional  Journalists for its <a title="link to interactive" href="http://reesenews.org/2010/12/16/staying-in-bounds/7929/" target="_blank">&#8220;Staying in Bounds&#8221; interactive </a>game that helped  explain the intricacies of NCAA compliance rules for student-athletes.</p>
<p>Jean  Folkerts, dean of the school, said Clark&#8217;s leadership is a significant  boost to the journalism school&#8217;s digital mission. &#8220;He understands the  critical importance of audience research to the news industry, and he  will build a powerful research infrastructure for reesenews.org,&#8221; said  Folkerts. &#8220;He knows where technology is taking us, and his students are  going to shape the future of the mobile news platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m  excited to be a part of such a critical project for our industry,&#8221; said  Clark. &#8220;As the Web matures and the mobile world explodes, students in  the digital newsroom will develop theories and test them in a practical,  real-world environment &#8211; and report the findings back to the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John  has always had a passion for teaching, and there is not a better  position in the world for a person with his background and experience,&#8221;  said Jimmy Goodmon, vice president and general manager of the CBC New  Media Group that operates WRAL.com. &#8220;There is not a better person than  John to bring a real world digital newsroom experience to the students  of today and our colleagues of tomorrow. UNC and its students will be  well served by his experience, his knowledge, his kindness and his  passion for helping others grow and learn.&#8221;</p>

Throughout the semester, we gathered a wide variety of data on how <a href="http://reesenews.org" target="_blank">Reesenews.org</a> is used. We track how many people read each story, which page elements are getting the most clicks, how many people are interacting with our Facebook page, and more.</p>
<p>These metrics, which are completely anonymous, give us valuable insight into our site and social media pages. Do our most popular stories have anything in common? How often do readers visit the homepage? How many views are Facebook &#8220;likes&#8221; driving to the site? This information then helps us to better serve our readers.</p>
<p>This report provides an overview of site and social media metrics for the data collection period 01/10/2011 &#8211; 04/23/2011 (except for video data, which was gathered between 01/10/2011 &#8211; 04/26/2011). It analyzes data to highlight trends in usage and audience behavior and provides comparisons with the fall 2010 metrics report.</p>
<p>Several parts of this report were crafted to specifically address questions from the North Carolina journalism community. Thank you for your input.</p>

<p>Multi-platform developer <a href="http://reesenews.org/author/wrightsa/">Seth Wright</a> is responsible for much of the code behind <a title="ReeseFelts" href="http://reesefelts.org">reesefelts.org</a> and <a title="ReeseNews" href="http://reesenews.org">reesenews.org</a>, in addition to a variety of other applications and pieces of content on the site.</p>
<p>Here, I talk with Seth about the code and inspiration behind the recent <a title="Shot by Shot" href="http://reesenews.org/2011/03/20/shot-by-shot/12670/" target="_blank">Shot by Shot database</a> (co-developed by Ashley Bennett) and the <a title="Pick the Winning Shot" href="http://reesenews.org/2011/03/22/interactive-pick-the-winning-shot/12933/">Pick the Winning Shot game</a> (co-developed with <a title="Evan Bell" href="http://reesenews.org/author/evanbell/">Evan Bell</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Where did the idea for <a title="Story page" href="http://reesenews.org/2011/03/20/shot-by-shot/12670/">Shot by Shot</a> come from?</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Ashley Bennett, Kristen Long and I were in Washington, D.C. [for <a href="http://conference.journalists.org/2010conference/">last year's ONA conference</a>],  and we had just gone through this session of programmers and designers.  It was one of the coolest sessions they had at the event, and they gave  you beer, actually. Me and Ashley and Kristen were sitting there,  having a great time, when Jonathan Harris came onstage. He&#8217;s an online  artist who develops all these crazy programs. For example, he developed &#8220;<a title="We Feel Fine" href="http://www.wefeelfine.org/" target="_blank">We Feel Fine</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>We saw one of his projects called &#8220;<a title="The Whale Hunt" href="http://thewhalehunt.org/" target="_blank">The Whale Hunt</a>,&#8221;  where every five minutes he forced himself to take an image and tag it  based on his heart rate and what type of thing was going on — was he  killing the whale? Was he riding in a boat or on a plane? That sort of  thing.</p>
<p>He tagged all those photos, and you could sort through and say, &#8220;I  want this heart rate, with this type of event,&#8221; and it would give you  those images.</p>
<p>We figured it would be great to use this for basketball. We had tons  of images from the year, and people had no good way to see, say, a photo  of Harrison Barnes dunking during the N.C. State game. Now, when you do  that query, one of our best photos pops up.</p>
<p><strong>How does the database work?</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a folder on our server full of different images that Andrew  Dye, Daniel Sircar, Jessey Dearing, and our other photographers took  throughout the year. We wrote an XML document that associates  information with each photograph. So each photo will have a caption, and  the document will also say what types of categories are associated with  it.</p>
<p>That information gets loaded into Flash, and using ActionScript, I  parse it all out so users can select different categories on the side.  That then tells the program what the users are looking for, and the code  filters through the XML and loads them in.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What about plans for the future? Any ways the database could be improved?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s completely updatable, but right now there&#8217;s no back-end. That  means there&#8217;s no page a reporter could go to and fill out an HTML form  that says, &#8220;Here&#8217;s an image, and I want to add this to the database.&#8221;  Right now, you have to be sort of tech-savvy and know how to write XML.  You have to go into the file and say, &#8220;here&#8217;s the image, here are the  tags,&#8221; and if you mess up one bracket or greater-than or less-than  symbol, the whole thing breaks.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t want to hand that to just any reporter. It would be cool if,  whoever comes in next year, could develop a back-end in PHP for  journalists to come in and fill out forms about the photos. Then, that  would automatically update a MySQL database, which would write that  exact same XML file the exact same way.eet</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just one more step that we haven&#8217;t taken, and maybe we don&#8217;t  have time to take now because we only have three weeks left until the  end of the semester. But future-wise, I&#8217;d love to see somebody do that.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s move on to Pick the Winning Shot. How does the game work?</strong></p>
<p><a title="game page" href="http://reesenews.org/2011/03/22/interactive-pick-the-winning-shot/12933/" target="_blank">&#8220;Pick the Winning Shot&#8221;</a> loads in a similar way, using XML. Each shot has its own branch of XML.  For each shot, the document lists what the correct answer is, and where  the feet were — the X and Y positions — and then it gives you four  slots for hints.</p>
<p>After you fill out all of that, the data loads into the Flash file  and gets spit out completely randomly. You might get different shots at  different times, and you might not even see certain shots if you don&#8217;t  play over and over again. The last thing the document contains is a bank  of every player, for every year that we use. We just load those players  in randomly to be the wrong answer choices.</p>
<p>Once it gets into Flash, it&#8217;s all ActionScript.</p>
<p><strong>What about the leaderboard at the end of the game?</strong></p>
<p>That was a pain, at first. When you write code, it executes in the  order you write it, line by line. There was a problem where I had  deleted something before I was trying to put in a new name on the  leaderboard. So it was erasing the name and then trying to say, &#8220;Put  this in at the last spot,&#8221; so then the leaderboard just started ticking  down, and the board would run out of slots eventually.</p>
<p>It took me a while to figure that out, but everyone makes mistakes  while programming. That&#8217;s part of my addiction to programming — finding  those little errors, and then spending hours staring at the code,  solving them. Then when you win those battles, you&#8217;re excited. That&#8217;s  part of the fun.</p>
<p>The leaderboard was a huge part of why that game was so fun. We saw  people on forums saying things like, &#8220;2570, my initials are C.M.,  they&#8217;re up there,&#8221; and then the next person comes back &#8220;2580, I&#8217;m A.B.&#8221;  They&#8217;re arguing on forums about who can get the better score.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think anyone got a perfect score, but that scoreboard was huge.</p>
<p><strong>We gave users the ability to embed the game on their own site  by clicking a button within the game. Can you talk about why that&#8217;s  important?</strong></p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the great things about building a Flash file or a video  file, any type of content that can be put on another site. Why not let  people embed the content — why not share the content with other people?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what made &#8220;<a title="Staying in Bounds on Reesenews" href="http://reesenews.org/2010/12/16/staying-in-bounds/7929/">Staying in Bounds</a>&#8221; go viral, the fact that the <a title="Staying in Bounds on News and Observer" href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2011/01/12/917018/could-you-survive-an-ncaa-investigation.html#storylink=misearch">News and Observer</a> could embed it, and that then Sports Illustrated linked to somebody  else who embedded it. Sports Illustrated reads that blog, but they don&#8217;t  read reesenews. 60,000 people came to our site because of those embeds —  that&#8217;s huge.</p>
<p>With &#8220;Pick the Winning Shot,&#8221; the embeddable option was kind of an  afterthought. But again, we noticed right away that people who were  playing it and had their own websites, and were tech-savvy enough to put  it in a page, did it. It&#8217;s already been embedded multiple times.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to extend this to our text stories as well, as a project for  next year&#8217;s developers. I wish there were some easy way, besides  copying and pasting, for users to embed our text stories on their own  page and say, &#8220;This was from reesenews.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Content is king.”</p>
<p>It’s a popular maxim among online news producers: The more content you have published on your website — regardless of the quality — the more people will end up on your homepage.</p>
<p>But this hunger for content is partly to blame for the deluge of Internet news minutia which lacks any real, lasting value.</p>
<p>It’s time for a revolution.</p>
<p>Two recent occurrences gave me the courage to defy the aforementioned “king.” The first reminds us what good content is. The second highlights the importance of how we publish and exhibit good content:</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large">1.</span></strong> It’s been months since I read David Simon’s <em>Homicide</em>, but my mind is still buzzing from his approach to journalism.</p>
<p>Simon’s nonfiction narrative profiles Baltimore homicide detectives during the course of a year as they slog through the lowest depths of humanity. It reads like fiction but it’s all fact.</p>
<p>It’s reporting, but how do we categorize this type of journalism?</p>
<p>Writer Richard Price enlightened me with his foreword from the book.</p>
<p>David Simon isn’t just a journalist, he argues. He’s a documentarian, a chronicler, he said. As such, he has the duty to spend real time with his subjects and to present the truth.</p>
<p>Price describes the chronicler’s vow this way:</p>
<p>“As a chronicler I will honor you with the faithful reporting of what I see and hear while a guest in the house of your life. As for how you come off, you dig your own grave or build your own monument by being who you are, so good luck and thanks for your time.”</p>
<p>Reporters frequently evaluate and identify their primary audience. Simon’s focus was and continues to be on the people that he’s chronicling. He knows he’s faithfully reported on a topic when its principal actors have been accurately portrayed.</p>
<p>It’s easy for me to say that Simon’s work in <em>Homicide</em> went beyond mere reporting. But that’s not fair.</p>
<p>While his work was more comprehensive than typical beat journalism, perhaps it was simply an example of what good reporting should be. As Price said, good reporting is chronicling.</p>
<p>Besides, many good beat reporters work hard to live up to the same ideals as the best chroniclers. There are still men and women across the world working hard and spending real time with their sources to give audiences the truth.</p>
<p>To his year-long profile of a homicide detective unit, Simon added years of experience as a crime reporter with <em>The Baltimore Sun</em>. For reasons of his own, he thought it necessary to document Baltimore’s killing streets in a way that wouldn’t have been feasible for a daily newspaper.</p>
<p>The lesson here isn’t what can or cannot be achieved by a given news outlet. The lesson is in the mindset of the journalists and their employers as individuals.</p>
<p>Simon’s idea to embed himself inside of a particular topic still seems radical despite the influx of behind-the-scenes exposes and the rise of niche reporting.</p>
<p>Simon didn’t just take us behind the scenes. He didn’t just expose. He documented. <em>He chronicled.</em></p>
<p>But most importantly, he delivered by telling us a compelling story.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: large">2.</span></strong> I recently interviewed a film archivist named <a title="Skip Elsheimer's A/V Geeks website" href="http://www.avgeeks.com/wp2/" target="_blank">Skip Elsheimer</a>. In addition to his archival work, Elsheimer shows films from his collection at public screenings.</p>
<p>Elsheimer pointed to the problem of people getting information overload from websites like Google News and YouTube.</p>
<p>“With all this content, we’re going to need people to curate it,” Elsheimer said. “To present it. To say, ‘Hey, here’s some thing things I dug into this giant well of data and I’ve pulled out these things.’”</p>
<p>It’s true, and equally applicable to the news industry. Reevaluating the manner in which a story is chosen and presented is becoming increasingly necessary as the amount of content being produced isn’t likely to subside anytime soon. To Elsheimer, that means increasing the number of archivists and content aggregators willing to pull out a story from all the noise.</p>
<p>But this leaves us with a conundrum: Should we bother with bottomless <strong></strong>content gathering if what is gathered has little redeeming value?</p>
<p>What content producers should be asking themselves right now is the same question every consumer is asking: Is this content worth my time?</p>
<p>The importance of that question will continue to grow in the years to come as the amount of content increases in relation to the amount of time viewers and readers have to spend on it.</p>
<p>There’s a better maxim to live by — one that provides content  consumers  with the complete, accurate story they need, but that gives  content  producers a better sense of direction when crafting their  story.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this piece I called for the removal of one ruling monarch.  I suggest we replace it with another:</p>
<p>“Story is king.”</p>
<p>Long live the king.</p>

<p><!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 13.0px 0.0px; line-height: 19.0px; font: 13.0px Georgia} -->Last weekend, students danced for 24 hours straight in UNC&#8217;s Fetzer Gym. They all gathered to be part of the annual <a title="UNC DM 2011" href="http://www.uncmarathon.org/" target="_blank">UNC Dance Marathon</a>, the university&#8217;s largest charity event.</p>
<p><a href="http://reesenews.org" target="_blank">Reesenews</a> wanted to be in on the action.</p>
<p>From talking to the UNC Dance Marathon committee beforehand, we knew many of the dancers would bring their smartphones to the event. They would use their iPhones, BlackBerrys and Androids to communicate with one another and with the outside world. This, we decided, was the perfect chance to experiment with mobile.</p>
<p>So, at the end of last week, we built a mobile micro-site called <a href="http://uncdm.reesenews.org" target="_blank">&#8220;UNC Dance Marathon Live.&#8221;</a> The site was a place for dancers to share photos and tweets with one another straight from their mobile devices, and for those outside the marathon to take a look into what was happening in Fetzer. We used a WordPress mobile sniffer plugin and then redesigned a theme to fit Dance Marathon&#8217;s branding. We built tweets and a streaming video into the theme, but used WordPress&#8217; built-in blog functionality to aggregate user-generated content.</p>
<p>These resources allowed us to make both the mobile and desktop version of the website in just two days.</p>
<p>If you visit the site from your computer, you&#8217;ll see a special non-mobile version of the site. Reesenews multimedia developer Seth Wright says our goal was to deliver a similar experience to what you would get on a mobile device to users&#8217; desktops.</p>
<p>&#8220;We made a HTML page with the exact same code as the mobile site,&#8221; Seth says. &#8220;However, we placed a large iPhone 4 mask on top of the content. The result was a mobile-like desktop experience.&#8221;</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1279" href="http://reesefelts.org/2011/02/28/unc-dance-marathon-live-and-mobile/uncdm-reesenews/"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1279" src="http://reesefelts.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2011/02/uncdm.reesenews-300x270.png" alt="uncdm.reesenews.org" width="300" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>We got the word out about the site through social media marketing and through offline promotion at the event itself. Once the dancing started and the sharing began, it became clear a community hub was exactly what the dancers wanted.</p>
<p>The site was popular.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the marathon on Friday until mid-Monday, the mobile site received 3,127 total views. Most of the views (2,684) were received during the marathon itself. The remainder was received afterward — by then, the site had become a comprehensive archive of information from the marathon. More than half of the visitors to the site (1,787) used a smartphone of some kind, while the rest used a computer.</p>
<p>Most of these visitors weren&#8217;t referred by an outside Web page. Instead, they visited the site directly by typing the URL directly into their phone or computer. While only 28 hits came from twitter.com, we have no way of tracking  hits from third-party Twitter applications like Tweetdeck and Hootsuite. The UNC student organization Web page for <a title="UNC Dance Marathon" href="http://studentorgs.unc.edu/dancemarathon/" target="_blank">Dance Marathon</a> referred 696 visits to the micro-site, and reesenews.org forwarded 154, the majority of views (2,121) weren&#8217;t referred. This shows the importance and impact of our offline marketing to dancers during the event itself.</p>
<p>In the future, we&#8217;d like to integrate geo-location services like Foursquare into our coverage as well. However, Dance Marathon served well as a test run of mobile strategy, and we want to continue to experiment with mobile&#8217;s potential to reach and engage audiences at specific events.</p>

<p>Working at Reesenews has provided me with the opportunity to use data in a meaningful way. But it also has made me realize a problem we face as visual  journalists — the misuse of information visualization.</p>
<p>It is easy to fall into the trap of wanting to use some kind of visualization for every single article that is written, especially with such buzz words as &#8220;alternative story forms,&#8221; &#8220;interactives&#8221; and &#8220;infographics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the mission of Reesenews is to be on the cutting edge of these trends in information visualization. Yes, infographics pull readers in, but sometimes (I hate to say it as a graphic designer myself and not a writer) words speak louder than visuals that prove nothing.</p>
<p>Of course data visualizations have their place. Elections are a great time to use data visualizations to show the results, as illustrated in our <a href="http://reesenews.org/2010/11/03/diary-of-a-concession-party/3761/">election results graphic</a> that I helped create.</p>
<p>The recent success of our <a href="http://reesenews.org/2010/12/16/staying-in-bounds/7929/">interactive NCAA football investigation game</a> shows that people enjoy interacting with the news and being challenged by it.</p>
<p>Interactive infographics are just plain fun.</p>
<p>What is important, however, is that as journalists we don&#8217;t lose sight of the news value of what we&#8217;re creating. When I sat down to write the style guide for Reesenews, I wanted to make this clear. The style guide reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As with simpler graphics, function trumps form. If there is the potential for a graphic, find the data to make it or don’t make it at all.<br />
Don’t make a graphic complex just for the sake of it being complex. There must be a reason that the information is important.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Style will only get a visual journalist so far if there is no data to back up the style. If there is no content or data, there is no story and no graphic.</p>
<p>At the Nov. 1 launch of Reesenews, there was a push for interactive pieces and information visualizations to prepare the site for launch, but what I realize now is that it is more important to spend more time on larger projects than to force data into graphics that aren&#8217;t really necessary or terribly interesting.</p>
<p>The pieces we&#8217;ve created recently at Reesenews are far more compelling and relevant than some of those earlier graphics created for launch, and it&#8217;s because we took the time to determine the news value and put our time and resources into projects that were newsworthy and walk away from those that were not.</p>
<p>Our role as digital journalists is not to pump out stories or infographics. There are no pages to fill, only stories to tell and people to inform.</p>

<p><a title="The Daily" href="http://www.thedaily.com/" target="_blank">The Daily</a>, Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s iPad-only news publication, was <a title="Mashable The Daily unveiled" href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/02/the-daily-launch/" target="_blank">unveiled today</a> at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Reesenews multi-platform developer Seth Wright and I sat down and spent some time with the app.</p>
<p>Our first impressions?</p>
<p>Though it has several usability problems and doesn&#8217;t offer as many complex interactive features as we would have liked, it&#8217;s attractive, full of interesting multimedia content and uses the iPad touch-based interface well.</p>
<p>The app is designed in a sleek, browser-friendly format that most resembles a news magazine. Our favorite part was its page-based format; we could turn from page to page and see many different kinds of content, all without leaving the &#8220;magazine&#8221; itself. We even liked the way the advertisements were integrated and ended up watching and interacting with them.</p>
<p>When you launch The Daily, you&#8217;re greeted with the introductory animation at the beginning of this video:</p>

<p>It&#8217;s engaging, but it also plays at the beginning of every video in the app. We quickly got tired of seeing it and wished there was a way to disable it. We&#8217;ve actually dealt with this issue at Reesenews – we used to play an introduction to each of our videos, but discovered that the slight delay annoyed our users (see the difference yourself: <a title="Halloween Reesenews" href="http://reesenews.org/2010/11/01/meet-fred-flintstone-and-a-host-of-others-on-franklin-st/2840/" target="_blank">this video</a> includes our introduction, while <a title="GPS and a Doctor reesenews" href="http://reesenews.org/2010/11/09/the-doctor-is-in/4597/" target="_blank">this</a> doesn&#8217;t).</p>
<p>After we logged in, The Daily asked for our location. One of the reasons for this is to notify us of breaking news in our area. This is certainly a useful feature — one that&#8217;s ripe for integration with the iPhone and other mobile gadgets.</p>
<p>Then, we landed on the home page, a carousel-like display of the publication&#8217;s various pages, with weather and other information displayed above. The interface reminded me of Google&#8217;s <a title="Google Fast Flip" href="http://fastflip.googlelabs.com/" target="_blank">Fast Flip</a>, but whereas Fast Flip&#8217;s page-turning format feels clunky and foreign on the computer, The Daily&#8217;s page-based interface felt more intuitive on the iPad.</p>
<p>We could swipe to spin the carousel, but it seemed to move slowly, as if it was having trouble loading. The pages were also a little too small, which made it hard to actually choose one to zoom in on.</p>
<p>There are two ways to zoom in on the publication itself. The first is to tap a page in the carousel, and the second is to choose a section (&#8220;News,&#8221; &#8220;Gossip,&#8221; &#8220;Sports,&#8221; etc.) from a menu bar on the home page. Once you zoom in, you swipe left or right to move between pages.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said above, all of The Daily&#8217;s content is designed within the same page format — we never had to leave the &#8220;magazine&#8221; while browsing. The result was a seamless experience despite the variety of content. We glided through several news stories and full-page pictures, the gossip section, interactive features and a panoramic photo, iPad app reviews and a Sudoku, and into the sports section.</p>
<p>The pages featured a variety of media, including text, photos, videos, interactive features, games and polls (or a combination of these). Several advertisements were interspersed with the content, but they were so well-designed and integrated that we ended up interacting with them as well.</p>
<p>Social tools were available, but weren&#8217;t distracting. At several points — in a story on the Egyptian protests and in another on the Super Bowl — a Twitter feed was embedded within the page, displaying results from a relevant search query or hashtag.</p>
<p>A Twitter feed can add a great deal of context to a story and when news breaks, tweets from those at the scene can often give more information than an official news story. Seth is actually working to give this ability to Reesenews reporters, so it was great to see it used in The Daily.</p>
<p>A small button in the top-right corner let us share content on Facebook and Twitter or leave a public comment within the publication. Comments could be typed or recorded. This feature surprised us – it was the first time I&#8217;d come across the ability to leave audio comments, but an iPad-specific publication is the perfect place to try out such a feature since each iPad has a built-in microphone. Seth compared it to the ability to call into a radio show and voice your opinion on the air.</p>
<p>One usability issue bothered us more than others. If you turn the iPad on its side while reading a news story, the display changes to a story-specific photo gallery. The gallery itself is great – the photos look good on the iPad screen, and we could swipe from photo to photo at our own pace. However, if you scroll too far, you&#8217;re brought into a completely new story. This disoriented us.</p>
<p>Also, when we turned the iPad back to its original position, we weren&#8217;t returned to the original page. Instead, we were brought to a whole new page. We hope The Daily&#8217;s designers fix the issue, because we liked the ability to turn the iPad to switch between a story&#8217;s photo gallery and the story itself.</p>
<p>According to <a title="Mashable The Daily unveiled" href="http://mashable.com/2011/02/02/the-daily-launch/" target="_blank">Mashable</a>, the app will be offered for $0.99 per week, or for $39.99 per year. We weren&#8217;t sure it was worth the price (but we are college students, after all).</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s available for free for the next two weeks – so if you&#8217;ve got an iPad, download it, try it out and let us know what you think in the comments. Is it unique enough and does it offer enough valuable content to be worth the money?</p>

<p>When I was first asked to join the staff at <a title="project news website" href="http://reesenews.org" target="_blank">reesenews</a>, I wasn’t sure what being a platform producer meant.</p>
<p>Like many other aspiring journalists in my generation, most of my writing and editing experience has been online. As a public affairs intern with the Department of Defense this summer, I either blogged using WordPress or published content to the public website.</p>
<p>However, there are similarities between print and digital journalism. And as I soon realized, a platform producer is just a fancy name for an online copy editor.</p>
<p>Like print editors, a platform producer develops headlines. Writes subheads. Checks stories for grammar, spelling and consistency. Makes sure things “fit” in the space available.</p>
<p>Unlike print editors, platform producers (and online editors in general) also must think about using Search Engine Optimization, tagging key words in stories, and publishing and updating wire and staff stories several times a day.</p>
<p>At reesenews, we use WordPress to publish all of our content. What I’ve enjoyed most about working in an online medium like WordPress is the versatility. While I enjoy being in the newsroom, working for an online publication means that when need be, I can continue working elsewhere.</p>
<p>On several occasions last semester I was able to finish copy editing a story from a remote location on- or off-campus. This became especially useful during exams, when I could combine studying with updating reesenews, without physically going into the newsroom.</p>
<p>WordPress also has another useful function: auto-publishing. Using this function, the managing editors and platform producers are able to auto-schedule stories using WordPress. Before winter break, we used this function to automatically publish stories we had already copy edited to the website while we were away.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also just started publishing our<a title="Health for Kids graphic" href="http://reesenews.org/files/2011/01/20110117_healthforkids.swf?width=695&amp;height=425" target="_blank"> &#8220;Health for kids&#8221; interactive series</a>, which was auto-published after being edited and designed the week before.</p>
<p>Another advantage of working with an online publication is the versatility of the content. Key stories that begin in the homepage slider can be moved around the page as newer content is published.</p>
<p>As with virtually all online publications, reesenews has also reached a much wider audience than it would have in print. According to Noel Cody, the director of audience engagement, reesenews has drawn traffic from Canada, Germany, India, Thailand and even one user from Fiji.  Random.</p>
<p>I suspect that a lot of this traffic was made possible through the use of SEO, a concept I was familiar with before launch but had not yet used in practice. Since all of our content is published online, balancing SEO-friendly headlines with those that are also more user friendly is critical.</p>
<p>As Google’s Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Focusing too hard on specific tweaks to gain ranking in the organic results of search engines may not deliver the desired results. Search engine optimization is about putting your site&#8217;s best foot forward when it comes to visibility in search engines, but your ultimate consumers are your users, not search engines.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of spring semester, Andy Bechtel, an assistant professor at the UNC School of Journalism and Mass Communication, met with the platform producers to help us with this task.</p>
<p>We examined which stories were getting hits because of SEO, as well as how to make titles, such as “No Longer the Same” (a love story about an elderly war veteran and his wife), less obscure. I found it amazing that even something as miniscule as an image caption is important in the SEO process.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience working on and editing stories outside of print has proven to be both challenging and stimulating.</p>
<p>And a lot of copy editing jobs being advertised these days are remotely based. Pajama editing might just be the next best thing.</p>
<p>Since most of my editing experience is limited to the digital realm, I’m interested to know your thoughts. Do you prefer editing for an online or print publication? Why?</p>

<p>As I’ve built reesenews’ social media presence during the last few months, it’s been tempting to see the “social web” as a network of technologies.</p>
<p><strong> </strong>There are dozens of social media sites online; Facebook, Twitter, StumbleUpon, YouTube, Flickr and the rest all offer different tools to share various forms of content. New tools to share information and content are constantly being created, and in a startup environment, it can be easy to get caught up in trying to take advantage of them all.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that the most obvious way to reach people who care about our stories was to create accounts and share content in as many media formats as I could, on as many of these sites as possible.</p>
<p>Turns out this is the wrong approach. As Google user-experience researcher Paul Adams says in his presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/padday/the-real-life-social-network-v2">&#8220;The Real Life Social Network,&#8221;</a> it&#8217;s important to &#8220;understand behavior, not technology.&#8221; In the presentation, he discusses how the social web is made up of people and their connections to each other. The technology is secondary.</p>
<p>As reesenews has gone through its start-up phase, I’ve found that it’s best to start small with social media. To begin with a few core sites, to build a genuine presence on each, and to branch out as the community builds.</p>
<p>Because, as Adams shows through his research, most users care more about connecting and sharing with one another than about the tools themselves. The trick for organizations using social media is to fit into that system in a meaningful way, without adding noise.</p>
<p>In the past few months, I’ve tried to build an active, engaged community around our content. I’ve tried to do this by making a genuine, two-way connection with users without simply “optimizing” social media or “driving page views.”</p>
<p>These value-laden terms, which you hear often in today’s buzz marketing world, look at people as numbers rather than as stakeholders and contributors in the news-making process.</p>
<p>Some of my social media initiatives have worked well. For instance, at the time that we launched <a title="reesenews.org" href="http://reesenews.org" target="_blank">reesenews.org</a>, I organized a <a title="Zoom in photo contest winners" href="http://reesenews.org/2010/11/29/zoom-in-photo-contest-winners/6490/" target="_blank">Facebook-based photo contest</a> with an advertising campaigns class in the journalism school — we then <a title="Zoom in photo contest" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=44177&amp;id=157282820949364" target="_blank">let the Facebook community pick</a> one of the winners.</p>
<p>After learning from this, we went on to host a similar contest, this time based around <a title="Gingerbread contest" href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=44177&amp;id=157282820949364" target="_blank">photos of gingerbread houses</a> built by UNC students. Our Facebook fans could “like” pictures of the gingerbread houses to vote for their favorites.</p>
<p>The contest received considerable response: the photos received about 340 views on the day of the contest, with views tapering off in the days following. In addition, on the day of the contest, over half of our page’s nearly 600 fans interacted with page content in some way, whether by looking through photos, clicking links, commenting, or “liking” content.</p>
<p>Other attempts to reach users, such as a “future of journalism discussion of the week” that I tried on our <a title="Reesenews linkedin group" href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups?mostPopular=&amp;gid=3494552&amp;trk=myg_ugrp_ovr" target="_blank">LinkedIn group page</a>, haven’t worked and must be re-evaluated.</p>
<p>Still other initiatives are just getting off the ground. We’ve just now organized our newsroom workflows to begin uploading all of our videos to YouTube, for example, and once we start I’ll work to find a following of YouTube users who value and respond to our videos. This winter I’ll also be working to build a presence on FourSquare by adding “tips” to locations around North Carolina based on reesenews stories.</p>
<p>I’ve found that in order to make a genuine connection with users, it’s important to put a human face on things. The goal is to become part of the community rather than a mechanical news machine. This means responding to other users on Twitter, avoiding auto-tweeting, thanking users for sharing our stories, and other personalized gestures.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to extend this human quality to our community guidelines, terms of service, creative-commons page and much of the other <a title="Reesenews community page" href="http://reesenews.org/community/" target="_blank">administrative content</a> on reesenews.org as well. Despite their importance, these are generally the least-viewed pages on websites — little surprise as they’re usually boring and full of jargon.</p>
<p>But I’ve tried to write these documents the way people normally talk, without an overly business-like tone. In fact, we’re planning to make our terms of service page even more engaging. Rather than present an intimidating wall of text to users, reesenews designers and I are planning to add pull-quotes and other graphics to make the page more easily-accessible.</p>
<p>As I’ve worked to share our stories online, I’ve learned that the communities that value our content can’t always be reached through our main social media channels. Sometimes, the best way to reach individuals interested in certain topics – stories on health care, for example – is to first reach people who social scientists like to call “gatekeepers” or “opinion leaders,” and ask them to recommend the story to others.</p>
<p>Gatekeepers, such as public health leaders,<strong> </strong>are connected to a community that trusts them for information on a given topic. Depending on a given story’s subject, I send or tweet the story to those gatekeepers who I believe will be interested.  Then it&#8217;s up to them to send the story out through their social network to others who are also likely to be interested.</p>
<p>By doing this, I’m trying to get stories to people who will care about them rather than simply sending the story to as many people as we can reach, merely adding unneeded noise to the TweetDecks of many.</p>
<p><a title="CNN research" href="http://cnninternational.presslift.com/socialmediaresearch" target="_blank">Research from CNN</a> shows that trusted recommendations are important: when users are recommended a story by somebody whose opinion they trust, they become more engaged with the news story. They are also 27 percent more likely to favor brands that advertise around the story and are 19 percent more likely to recommend those brands to others.</p>
<p>I’ve begun to target and build relationships with gatekeepers, and this semester I’ll be increasing my efforts in this area.</p>
<p>It seems that a personal social media approach fosters a more engaged network, and attracts more committed followers. I’m curious – do you have another take on this? How do you feel about the ways organizations try to reach users through social media?</p>
