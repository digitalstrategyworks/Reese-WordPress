Automatically generate a non-deprecated XML sitemap for inclusion to Google News 2.0.


== Description ==

The Google News XML Sitemap plugin automatically generates a Google News XML sitemap (yourdomain.com/google-news-sitemap.xml) whenever a post is created, updated or deleted. This sitemap needs to be submitted once to Google via Google Webmaster's Tools.

This plugin allows you to include/exclude posts, pages and categories in the Google News sitemap, as well as includes post tags as news keywords.

This plugin also follows Google News' latest (non-deprecated) format and guidelines:

* 50,000 post limit
* Only includes posts from last 2 days
* Includes PUBLICATION_NAME and other Google News-specific formatting

Unlike other sitemap generators, this plugin does not require any coding expertise and can be easily configured with just a couple of clicks.
