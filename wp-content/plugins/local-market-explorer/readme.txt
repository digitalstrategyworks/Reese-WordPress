This plugin allows WordPress to load data from a number of neighborhood-related APIs to be presented on a single page or within
your own pages / posts.

== Description ==

This plugin allows WordPress to load data from a number of neighborhood-related APIs to be presented on a single page or within
your own pages / posts. The different modules that this plugin contains are as follows:

* Real Estate Market Stats (via [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com))
* Real Estate Market Activity (via Zillow)
* Schools (via [Education.com](http://www.education.com))
* Walk Score (via [Walk Score](http://www.walkscore.com))
* Yelp (via [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com))
* Local Classes (via [TeachStreet](http://www.teachstreet.com))
* Local Content from NileGuide (via [Nile Guide](http://www.nileguide.com))
* IDX / MLS Real Estate Data (via [dsIDXpress](http://www.dsidxpress.com))
* Colleges (via [MatchCollege](http://www.matchcollege.com))
* Realtors (via [Homethinking](http://www.homethinking.com))

To use the modules on the pre-generated Local Market Explorer "virtual pages," you don't need to do anything other than link to
or visit the specially-crafted URLs that Local Market Explorer intercepts. The formats of these URLs look like this:

* &lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/_city_/_state_/&gt;
* &lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/_neighborhood_/_city_/_state_/&gt;
* &lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/_zip_/&gt;

For example, to load the Local Market Explorer for Seattle, WA, you'd simply need to point your browser to
&lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/seattle/wa/&gt;. If you have spaces in your city name, you can use hyphens for the spaces in
the URL, like so: &lt;http://www.yoursite.com/local/laguna-beach/ca/&gt;. You DO NOT need to pre-initialize these
URLs to work; simply having Local Market Explorer installed is enough to get any of these URLs to load the appropriate data.

To use the modules with your own pages and posts, you only need to insert the Local Market Explorer shortcode text via the
page / post editor. There's a small map icon in the toolbar editor that can help you do this.

More information and help can be found in the "Help" tab in the admin once the plugin is installed.

This plugin is open-source donationware. I'm willing to accept and integrate well-written patches into the code, but the
continued development of the plugin (new features, bug fixes, etc) by the plugin author is funded by either donations or
companies willing to pay a nominal fee to have their data integrated. You can thank Zillow and Education.com for funding the
vast majority of the development thus far. If you'd like to donate towards a particular feature however, please
[donate via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=10178626). Getting me something sweet
on [my Amazon wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/wishlist/7EQB35SN16H9/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go) would certainly help grease the wheels
for new features as well. I'm happily employed at [Diverse Solutions](http://www.diversesolutions.com) though and so some
feature ideas you may have are off-limits for me to work on.

If you'd like to contribute a feature suggestion or need to document a bug, please use the
[User Voice forum](http://localmarketexplorer.uservoice.com/) set up specifically for that purpose. With User Voice, each user
gets a fixed number of votes that they can cast for any particular bug or feature. The higher the number of votes for an item,
the higher the priority will be for that item as development commences on the plugin itself.

== Installation ==

1. Go to your WordPress admin area, then go to the "Plugins" area, then go to "Add New".
2. Search for "local market explorer" (sans quotes) in the plugin search box.
3. Click "Install" on the right, then click "Install" at the top-right in the window that comes up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize the styling and display format? =

Yes. All of the styles are controlled via an external CSS stylesheet named client.css (located in the 'css' folder). You can
easily override any of the styles in there. Be aware, however, that the default styles were created to be compliant with all of
the branding requirements of the different APIs. It's possible that overriding any of the styles could put you out of compliance
with the API provider(s).

= How do I draw attention to the pages for my target markets? =

There are a number of pre-built images you can use to use as calls to action on your sidebar or anywhere else. The images are
available in the following colors: black, blue, green, orange, and red. The images can be found in the following folder:
/wp-content/plugins/local-market-explorer/images/badges

= How do I add a sidebar module listing my target markets? =

From your WordPress admin interface, simply navigate to Appearance -> Widgets, then you can drag + drop the "Local Market
Explorer Areas" from the "Available Widgets" to a sidebar on the right (such as "Sidebar 1"). Once the widget is placed, you can
click the down-arrow on the newly placed widget to customize the title.

= The Market Activity module is not getting populated with recent sales data - why? =

The module is driven by a private API call that needs permissions to be granted to a specific Zillow API key.
To request access to this API, simply fill out the API upgrade form located
[here](http://www.zillow.com/webservice/APIUpgradeRequest.htm) and select "Local Market Explorer Wordpress Plugin" in the API
request type field. Once the request is processed, your market activity module should populate automatically with recent sales
data.
