**How Does Apture Work?**

Apture will insert two buttons into your posting flow.  One for making really cool [hyperlinks](http://help.apture.com/how-to-use-apture-for-hyperlinking-content-video-tutorial/ "hyperlinks") and other of [embedding](http://help.apture.com/how-to-use-apture-for-embedding-content-video-tutorial/ "embedding") great content.  Once you link up the content your readers will notice small icons next to your hyperlinks when they view your pages.  When they clicked they are treated to a [super slick animation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCTAv0xTGaY "super slick animation") revealing your content.
